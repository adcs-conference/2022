              <h3>Aim of the Symposium</h3>
              
              <p>
              ADCS 2022 is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in
              document computing and information retrieval to meet and present
              their work. The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document
              Computing - issues ranging from the fundamentals of document
              architectures and standards for markup, through storage,
              management, retrieval, authentication and workflow, to active and
              virtual documents. The symposium emphasises both commercial and
              academic issues by encouraging a variety of submissions. 
              </p>
               
              <h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
              
              <p>The symposium topics include (but are not restricted to) the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Cognitive Aspects of Documents</li>
                <li>Digital Libraries</li>

                <li>Web Search</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
               
              <h3>Submissions</h3>
              
              <p>
              ADCS 2022 will not differentiate between "full" and "short" 
              papers, adopting the successful approach trialled at
              <a href=https://ictir2021.org/call-for-papers/>ICTIR 2021</a>
              and <a href=https://adcs-conference.org/2021/>ADCS 2021</a>.
              Instead, papers must be between <strong>2 and 9
              pages</strong> for content, with an unrestricted amount of
              additional pages for references. That is, the minimum submission
              length is 2 pages plus references, and the maximum submission
              length is 9 pages plus references.
              Papers should be written such that the length is proportional to 
              the contribution.
              </p>

              <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
              <p>
              ADCS 2022 submissions may include an <strong>optional</strong> 
              "Ethical Considerations" section, where authors are invited to 
              include a statement on the ethical considerations and the wider 
              impacts of their research where applicable. Authors are urged to 
              read the 
              <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> 
              and to ensure that their work conforms to the code.
              </p>

              <h4>Paper Formatting and Submission</h4>
              <p>Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, in PDF
              format and formatted using the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM "sigconf" template</a>,
              also available on 
              <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty">Overleaf</a>.
              Please ensure your manuscript has been <strong>anonymized</strong> 
              for double blind review.
              </p> 
              <p>Papers will be submitted using <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=adcs2022">Easychair.</a>

              <h4>Paper Reviewing</h4>
              <p>All submissions will be fully refereed using a
              <strong>double blind</strong> refereeing process at their full 
              published length. Referees will assess whether the paper is an 
              appropriate length with respect to the content. Submissions which 
              are not anonymized, are under or over the page limit, or do not 
              follow the formatting guidelines will be rejected without review.
              </p>

              <h4>Publishing and Attendance</h4>
              <p>Submissions must be original work, not previously published
              elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or
              journal. </p>

              <p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that,
              should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend
              the symposium to present the work. Note also that it is insufficient
              for an author to register as fulfilling this obligation. 
              Although ADCS 2022 is planned principally as an in-person event, a 
              remote participation option will also be provided.
              </p>

              <p>In past symposia, electronic copies of accepted papers have been available
              through the ACM Digital Library as part of the ICPS
              collection.
              We therefore expect that authors of accepted papers will have to
              sign the ACM rights management form to comply with publication in the
              ACM digital library. </p>
