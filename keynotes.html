                    <h4>What users tell us: User Understanding and Modeling for Personalized Recommendation</h4>
                    <h5>December 9th, 12 pm AEDT</h5>

                    <p>Personalized   recommender   systems   have   been   one   of   the   major   ways   of   information
acquisition.   Understanding   the   user’s   intent   and   behavior   plays   an   important   role   and   has
been a trending topic in research and applications. In this talk, I will briefly introduce some
observations   and   findings   on   our   user   understanding   research   in   recent   years,   which   are
surprising or different from what people thought before. The topic in the talk involves user
behavior   analyses,   dynamic   intent   modeling,   and   evaluation   in   multiple   scenarios   such   as
news streaming, e-commerce, job hunting, and music recommendation. Related researches
have been published on ACM TOIS, WWW, SIGIR, WSDM, etc.</p>

                    <h4>Maximising the potential of documents, NLP, and AI in an online employment marketplace: Technical and non-technical challenges</h4>
                    <h5>February 24th, 12:30 pm AEDT</h5>

                    <p>SEEK is a leading employment marketplace with a global presence, connecting hundreds of millions of job seekers with 
                        job advertisements posted by millions of hirers across APAC and the Americas. Document processing is fundamental to 
                        all areas of our business, and multiple teams at SEEK face daily challenges about how to maximise the potential of 
                        our multinational, multilingual, multifaceted corpus of job ads, candidate resumes, and other employment documents. 
                        Although some of these challenges are familiar technical problems like accuracy, performance, and reliability of services, 
                        often the most difficult challenges we face are non-technical. How should large teams organise into autonomous units while avoiding 
                        silos of data and expertise? How can we use data and build AI services in an ethical way that is true to our purpose of helping SEEK’s 
                        users and protecting their personal data? In this talk I will discuss several of these challenges that we currently face at SEEK, 
                        and the solutions we have found to deal with them.</p>

                    <h4>About Dr Terrence Szymanski</h4>

                        AI services leveraging ML and NLP to provide rich understanding of the match between candidates
                        and job postings on SEEK’s platforms. Terrence previously worked as a data scientist at ANZ Bank
                        in Melbourne, as a postdoctoral researcher in text analytics at University College Dublin, and
